Just a funny translator for me and my friends, here are some stuff:

How Does Yenglihs Work?
Rules for transforming to Yenglihs (They must be followed in order):

Replace the first letter with "y" (e.g., Hello → Yello)
If a word begins with "y", add the prefix "la-" (e.g., Yellow → Layellow)
Swap the last two letters (e.g., Layellow → Layellwo)
For two-letter words: swap letters and add "l" if ends in vowel (e.g., As → Sal)
For single-letter vowels: add "l" (e.g., A → Al)
Add "l" at the end of words ending in a vowel (or 'y') (e.g., Me → Mel)
Modern only: Append original first letter and put a "y" in-between the first letter and the last one (e.g., Apple → Yppleya)
How to Reverse Yenglihs?
To reverse Yenglihs back to English (best effort, as some information is lost):

Attempt to remove the appended original first letter and any inserted "y" (Modern only).
Remove any trailing "l" that was added.
Undo the swap of the last two letters.
Remove "y" or "la-" prefixes and restore the original first letter if possible.
Handle two-letter and single-letter words as special cases.
